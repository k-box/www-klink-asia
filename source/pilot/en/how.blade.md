title: How K-Link works
description: How K-Link Works, from the Search Engine to the K-Link Core and the K-Link network
---


K-Link is a service oriented to document management within an organization, and at the same time enables creation of a community of practice between organizations involved in a specific topic.

It's like having your private organization search engine that targets valuable materials from your community.

With this goal in mind, the K-Link Architecture has a distributed component called [*K-Link Network*](#klink-network), including a set of [services that can run inside your institutions](#components).

</div>

<div class="my-8">

<p>The overall K-Link Architecture follows the approach of Service Oriented Architecture, where different components communicate together to offer a comprehensive service.</p>

<p>The Service Oriented Architecture allows for increased scalability and flexibility in the setup and deployment of services. In addition, each service runs in a sandbox to minimize the risk of a compromised service damaging the system.</p>

<p>Some services are deployed inside the institution/organization to preserve data ownership and establish a degree of offline access. Varying levels of user-access can be defined. Other services offered to the organization, such as the public network, are deployed externally.</p>

	<h3 id="components">K-Link Components</h3>

	<p>The K-Link Service oriented architecture is composed by four main components: a document management system, K-Core, a search engine and a geo-location extraction. These components enable the K-Link to perform searches, organize documents and respond to the K-Link goals previously identified.</p>

	<h2>K-Link Network</h2>

	


<div class="flex justify-between">

	<div class="w-1/2">

		<p>Is a distributed network where documents remain in the possession of their owners. Only metadata are stored on the network infrastructure, promoting faster searches.</p>

		<p>Documents are distributed on each network node, while search is performed on the Network Entry Point.</p>

		<p>The Network Entry Point servers are the access points to the network infrastructure, which offer search/retrieval and document indexing capabilities.</p>

		<p>The K-Link Network is constructed on top of the same base services that are deployed locally in the institution: the <strong>K-Core</strong>, the Search Engine and the Geographic Entity Recognition service.</p>
		
		<p>The interaction with the network is based on a secure Application Programming Interface (API) that enables the development of customized services and the usage of the organizationâ€™s existing infrastructure. In fact, this website uses the same API to offer the search.</p>

	<h2 id="added-value">Integration Methods</h2>

	<p>K-Link can be integrated inside your institution infrastructure in two different ways: (1) K-Box or (2) Custom integration. Integration with K-Box is defined as plug and play. In both cases, a requirement analysis and assessment study will take place to suggest the best way of empowering your institution with the services offered by K-Link.</p>

			<h3 class="mb-4">K-Box with K-Link DMS</h3>
			
			<p>If your institution does not have a server for storing/managing documents or you want the K-Link to be separated from you existing process we offer the K-Box solution.</p>

			<p>The K-Box offers all the K-Link Services (K-DMS, Public Network connection) in a single computer that you can attach to your local network. In this way the DMS will be accessible from inside your organization and can be accessed also from outside.</p>
