<p>A Proof-Of-Concept phase of K-Link was tested between February and May 2014. This phase included the workshop on March 24th where the K-Link was presented to relevant stakeholders whose feedback helped us to develop the roadmap for the future K-Link Pilot. 
The following and still ongoing phase started at the end of August. The Pilot Stage consist of implementation and dissemination of he data in cooperation with  selected number of local institutions and organizations.</p>

<p>This tricky adventure that raised both technical and conceptual issues had started in order to facilitate the exchange of expertise, best-practices and experience among stakeholders working in the field of Natural Resource Management. 
As opposite to the other attemps made, our aim is to share the organizations’ knowledge without creating cental hub and while mantaining and respecting the ownership of the organizations’ data.Moreover we do not start from scratch but we build on already existing practice.</p>
